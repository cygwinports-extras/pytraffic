ldesc: "PyTraffic is a Python version of the board game Rush Hour 
created by Binary Arts Coporation. The goal is to remove the red car 
out of the grid through the slot on the right. To do this you have to 
slide the other cars out of the way. PyTraffic comes with about 19,000 
puzzles ranging from intermediate to expert, and has an extremely smart 
hint facility which is able to find the best move in every position."
